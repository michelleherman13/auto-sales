### Project
There are a number of factors that can influence vehicle sales. They can range from political and economic issues to the supply chain and manufacturing. Due to time constraints, our team narrowed the scope to a diverse sample of possible drivers: gas price, unemployment rate, steel production, and consumer price indexes for new and used vehicles.

In this group project, our team examined these possible drivers to see if and how they relate to vehicle sales in the U.S. Through the use of statistical techniques, such as correlation and linear regression models, we were able to quantify the direction and strength of these drivers and their relationship with vehicle sales.

### Motivation
To explore specific drivers of influence on vehicle sales in the U.S. 


### Problem Solved
Our team wanted to find out how volatility in any of these drivers influenced vehicles sales. Knowing the state of any of these drivers and whether they may be decreasing or increasing may be useful to know if in the market for a vehicle.

### What Did We Learn
In addition to the statistical techniques we utilized during the data analysis, our team learned that there are several more factors that can influence vehicle sales. We also determined that the drivers we researched in this study, even though some of which may have a correlation to vehicles sales, the relationships were not strong enough to conclude that they were statistically significant and were unable to prove a correlation/causation effect.
