Motivation --  To explore specific drivers of influence on vehicle sales in U.S. 

Project --  Considered several drivers however due to time constraints our group focused on gasoline prices and how
		its prices correlated to the sale of vehicles in the U.S. 

Problem Solved - We wanted to find out if the volatiliy in gas prices had any influence in car sales which could influence car prices. 
			Knowing the state of gas prices and whether they may be decreasing or increasing in the future could be 
			useful when considering a vehicle purchase. 

What did you learn -- In addition to the the data analysis, our group discovered that there are many more drivers that have influence on 
			vehicle sales and even though there may be a correlation between gas prices and auto sales we could not determine if
			influence of gas prices was statistically significant and we could not conclude that it was a determinant of vehicle sales.

Our project considered several factors that could have an influence on vehicle sales in the U.S. We chose to focus on gasoline prices to see what
influence it had, if any, on vehicle sales. Through data analysis we were able to conclude .. not conclude....
