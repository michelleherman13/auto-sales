Automobile Trends in the United States
  
  
There are many factors that can influence vehicle sales. In this group project, our team examined several possible drivers to see if and how they relate to vehicle sales in the U.S. Through the use of statistical techniques, such as correlation and linear regression models, we were able to quantify the direction and strength of these drivers and their relationship with vehicle sales.

## Motivation
To explore specific drivers of influence on vehicle sales in the U.S. 

## Project
Although there are numerous factors of influence, ranging from political to economic to manufacturing and production, due to time constraints, our team focused on a diverse sample of these drivers: gas prices, unemployment rate, steel production, consumer price indexes for new and used vehicles. 

## Problem Solved
Our team wanted to find out how volatility in any of these drivers influenced vehicles sales. Knowing the state of any of these drivers and whether they may be decreasing or increasing may be useful to know if in the market for a vehicle. 

## What Did We Learn
In addition to the data analysis, our team learned that there are many more factors that can influence vehicle sales. We also determined that the drivers we researched in this study, even though some of which may have a correlation to vehicles sales, the relationships were not strong enough to conclude that they were statistically significant and were unable to prove a correlation/causation effect.
